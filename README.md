# N_Protein_Modelling

This folder contains 

(1) a script `N_Protein_Modelling.py` that creates and evaluates a Linear Regression model which predicts affinity of coronavirus N_proteins to human transcripts.

(2) a notebook `N_Protein_Modelling.ipynb` that explains the various steps used in the modelling process 

In the `N_Protein_Modelling.ipynb` several libraries were used including
